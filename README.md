# TODO
- Display the current score (number of points for each player pieces).
- Implement a way to play again on missclick.
- Implement game loading and move backward/forward in the game.
- Use GameGUI interface or delete it.
- Make a more human friendly interface for settings
- Externalize perfT data (I think it's more than the half of the package size for a very limited usage).
